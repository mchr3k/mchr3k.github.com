  <h2>Effective Altruism</h2>

  <h3>My Background</h3>

  <p>
    In 2016 I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4722934-the-life-you-can-save" target="_blank">The Life You Can Save by Peter Singer</a>. This book had a profound impact on me as I
    learned that there was strong evidence that saving a life through the most effective global health charities costs ~$5000 (<a href="https://www.givewell.org/impact-estimates" target="_blank"
      >source</a
    >). The book also made a strong moral argument that if you are in a high paying job then you should consider
    <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/how-much-money-should-we-donate-to-charity">giving 10% of your income</a> to
    <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">effective charities</a>. This is on the basis that being paid 90% of a high salary is likely to feel almost identical to being paid 100%
    and that 10% difference can literally save lives.
  </p>

  <p>
    I took the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge" target="_blank">Giving What We Can pledge</a> in 2017 to donate 10% of my income to effective charities. I primarily support the
    <a href="https://founderspledge.com/funds/climate-change-fund" target="_blank">Founders Pledge Climate Change Fund</a>.
  </p>

  <p>I wrote a talk in 2017 to summarize what I had learned about Effective Altruism and why I found it so compelling:</p>

  <h3>Climate Change</h3>

  <p>
    You have <a href="https://80000hours.org/start-here/" target="_blank">80,000 hours in your career: 40 hours per week, 50 weeks per year, for 40 years</a>. I am currently trying to spend my 80,000
    hours working on Climate Change.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2020 I had a <a href="https://80000hours.org/speak-with-us/" target="_blank">call with a consultant from 80,000 hours</a> to discuss the most effective way for me to apply my career to working
    on climate change. Since that call 80,000 Hours have been introducing other people to me who they speak to about wanting to work on Climate Change. Since then I have been introduced to 45+ other
    people who are interested in using their 80,000 hours to work on climate. I have had calls with 15+ of these people to discuss their situation and share my own perspective. Based on these calls I
    have written down some thoughts about

  </p>

  <p>I have written some articles related to the intersection between Effective Altruism and Climate Change:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      2019-10-07 - <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/heie24Ahb5LWqwtuS/updated-climate-change-problem-profile" target="_blank">Updated Climate Change Problem Profile</a> - In this
      post I detailed several points of feedback about the 80,000 Hours Climate Change problem profile (published in April 2016, still the latest version in March 2020) which I used as motivation to
      draft an updated problem profile. This problem profile has since been updated.
    </li>
    <li>
      2019-10-20 -
      <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ynRG6JBvARS2cHu63/review-of-climate-cost-effectiveness-analyses" target="_blank">Review of Climate Cost-Effectiveness Analyses</a> - In this
      post I examined four previous attempts to examine aspects of the impact of climate change and/or the cost-effectiveness of climate change interventions. I argued that the estimates which have
      been completed so far don't make a compelling case that mitigating climate change is actually order(s) of magnitude less effective compared to global health interventions, with many of the
      remaining uncertainties making it very plausible that climate change interventions are indeed much more effective.

      2020-05-23 - <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pcDAvaXBxTjRYMdEo/climate-change-is-neglected-by-ea" target="_blank">Climate Change Is Neglected By EA</a> - In this post I
      argued:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the full impacts of climate change, there is limited evidence about exactly what these impacts will be. EA has drawn questionable conclusions
          from the evidence that does exist.
        </li>
        <li>EA considers Climate Change as “not neglected” based on the amount of effort already being made, rather than the results achieved.</li>
        <li>
          EA downplays the huge impacts from currently expected levels of climate change (section 4), focusing instead on whether climate change is an x-risk. This approach risks alienating many
          people from EA.
        </li>
        <li>
          Climate change has many different impacts, this is a poor fit for EA which tries to quantify problems using simple models, leading to undervaluing of action on climate change. The EA model
          of prioritising between causes doesn't work for climate change which has a broad and effectively permanent impact.
        </li>
      </ol>
      The result of all of this is to visibly neglect and undervalue climate change in EA publications.
    </li>
  </ul>
