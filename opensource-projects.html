<h2>Open Source Projects</h2>

<p>
  This section of this site is focused on a collection of open source projects
  which I primarily worked on in the period 2010 - 2014. I don't actively
  support these any more.
</p>

<h3>InTrace (2010 - 2014)</h3>

<p>
  <a href="org.intrace/">InTrace</a> is a tool which enables the tracing of
  program execution without recompilation. You can easily trace your own
  classes, library classes or system classes. This tool can be used by adding a
  single extra JVM parameter to a new JVM process (see below) or by using the
  Eclipse plugin.
</p>

<h3>InMemProfiler (2010 - 2012)</h3>

<p>
  <a href="org.inmemprofiler/">InMemProfiler</a> is a tool for tracking the
  allocation and lifetime of Java objects. This tool aims to answer the
  following questions.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many instances of a class are being allocated?</li>
  <li>What are the most common stack traces of these allocations?</li>
  <li>How long do these instances live?</li>
  <li>What class is responsible for their allocation?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Java Thread Dump Analyser (2011 - 2012)</h3>

<p>
  <a href="javathreaddumpanalyser/">Java Thread Dump Analyser</a> is a tool for
  quickly summarising lengthy Java thread dumps.
</p>

<h3>Java Live Thread Analyser (2012)</h3>

  <a href="jlta/">Java Live Thread Analyser</a> is a tool for identifying the
  source of Java thread allocations.
</p>

  applications into a single cross platform Jar.

<p>
  <a href="jdeclipse-realign/">JDEclipse-Realign</a> is a fork of a project
  which enhances JD Eclipse to align the generated source code with the correct
  debug line numbers.
</p>

<h3>Code Trails (2012)</h3>

<p>
  <a href="codetrails/">Code Trails</a> are collections of simple markers within
  code comments that highlight particular functionality and themes. The Code
