    <h3>Hi, I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>!</h3>
    <p>I'm a Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead.</p>
    <p>
      Focused on working to address the
      <a href="/climate-change.html"> climate crisis</a> since ~2019. I'm currently exclusively interested in roles which directly drive reductions in CO2e emissions / atmospheric CO2e concentrations
      or which contribute to the global energy transition.

    <p>
      <a href="/effective-altruism.html"> Effective Altruist</a> since ~2017. I took the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge" target="_blank">Giving What We Can pledge</a> in 2017 to
      donate 10% of my income to effective charities. I primarily support the <a href="https://founderspledge.com/funds/climate-change-fund" target="_blank">Founders Pledge Climate Change Fund</a>.

    <p>I love <a href="/reading.html"> reading</a> to help me better understand the world. Sometimes I <a href="/writing.html"> write</a> down some of my thoughts.</p>
