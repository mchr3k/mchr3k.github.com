<h3>InTrace (2010 - 2014)</h3>

<p><a href="org.intrace/">InTrace</a> is a tool which enables the tracing of program execution without recompilation. You 
can easily trace your own classes, library classes or system classes. This tool can be used by 
adding a single extra JVM parameter to a new JVM process (see below) or by using the Eclipse plugin. 

<h3>InMemProfiler (2010 - 2012)</h3>

<p><a href="org.inmemprofiler/">InMemProfiler</a> is a tool for tracking the allocation and lifetime of Java objects. This tool aims to answer the following questions.

<ul>
<li>How many instances of a class are being allocated?
<li>What are the most common stack traces of these allocations?
<li>How long do these instances live?
<li>What class is responsible for their allocation?
</ul>
