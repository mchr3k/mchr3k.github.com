    <h3>Hi, I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>!</h3>
    <p>I'm a Staff Software Engineer.</p>
    <p>
      Focused on working to address the
      <a href="/climate-change.html"> climate crisis</a> since ~2019. I'm currently exclusively interested in roles which directly drive reductions in CO2e emissions / atmospheric CO2e concentrations
      or which contribute to the global energy transition.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="/effective-altruism.html"> Effective Altruist</a> since ~2017. I took the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge" target="_blank">Giving What We Can pledge</a> in 2017 to
      donate 10% of my income to effective charities. I primarily supported the <a href="https://founderspledge.com/funds/climate-change-fund" target="_blank">Founders Pledge Climate Change Fund</a>.
      In 2023 I accepted a new Climate Tech job which involved taking a &gt;10% salary pay cut and so for now I'm treating that choice of job as counting against my Giving What We Can pledge in 
      place of donating cash.

    <p>I love <a href="/reading.html"> reading</a> to help me better understand the world.</p>

        >“Hope is not a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch, feeling lucky. It is an axe you break down doors with in an emergency. Hope should shove you out the door, because it will
        take everything you have to steer the future away from endless war, from the annihilation of the earth's treasures and the grinding down of the poor and marginal... To hope is to give yourself
        to the future - and that commitment to the future is what makes the present inhabitable.”</span
