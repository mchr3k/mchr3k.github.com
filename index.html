<p>This site describes all of the open source projects which I work on.

<h3>InTrace</h3>

<p><a href="org.intrace/">InTrace</a> is a tool which enables the tracing of program execution without recompilation. You 
can easily trace your own classes, library classes or system classes. This tool can be used by 
adding a single extra JVM parameter to a new JVM process (see below) or by using the Eclipse plugin. 

<h3>InMemProfiler</h3>

<p><a href="org.inmemprofiler/">InMemProfiler</a> is a tool for tracking the allocation and lifetime of Java objects. This tool aims to answer the following questions.

<ul>
<li>How many instances of a class are being allocated?
<li>What are the most common stack traces of these allocations?
<li>How long do these instances live?
<li>What class is responsible for their allocation?
</ul>

<h3>Java Thread Dump Analyser</h3>

<p><a href="javathreaddumpanalyser/">Java Thread Dump Analyser</a> is a tool for quickly summarising lengthy Java thread dumps.

<h3>Java Live Thread Analyser</h3>

<p><a href="jlta/">Java Live Thread Analyser</a> is a tool for identifying the source of Java thread allocations.

<h3>SWTJar</h3>

<p><a href="swtjar/">SWTJar</a> is a tool for easily packaging SWT Java applications into a single cross platform Jar.

<h3>EmmaCheck</h3>

<p><a href="emmacheck/">EmmaCheck</a> is an ant task which enforces particular Java code coverage levels.

<h3>JDEclipse-Realign</h3>

<p><a href="jdeclipse-realign/">JDEclipse-Realign</a> is a fork of a project which enhances JD Eclipse to align the generated source
code with the correct debug line numbers.
