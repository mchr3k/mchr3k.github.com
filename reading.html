  <h3>2023</h3>

  <p>In 2023 I read 55 books. These are the five books which I would recommend most strongly:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity: An incredible book which opened my eyes to the rich history of social experimentation in early human society. 
      However, <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/01/13/the-roots-of-inequality-an-exchange/">this</a> is an interesting critique which claims that the authors
      overstate or oversimplify some of their presentations of the academic research. The book also left me wanting more, as it doesn't attempt to address the important question 
      of whether or not the kind of social experimentation which was historically common could still work in the modern world in the face of modern technology and a global 
      population of billions.
    </li>
    <li>Politics On the Edge: A Memoir From Within - This provides a powerful insight into the weird realities of being an elected MP within the current remarkably dyfunctional Westminster system.</li>
    <li>The Overstory - A fantastic fiction book which has given me a genuinely new perspective on the value, importance, and complexity of forests.
      Woven into the story I learned things like that in north america there are entire forests of genetically identical aspen trees that are all connected together into a single giant root system. 
      Each trunk grows and eventually dies, but the underlying root system, the collective genetically distinct organism lives on. The biggest known example of this is called Pando. 
      We're not sure how old Pando is. Probably more than 10,000 years old.</li>
    <li>How to Speak Whale - The remarkeable story of the scientific project to learn how to talk to whales.</li>
    <li>Cloud Cuckoo Land - A beautiful story about the very human process of handing down stories through time.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>2022</h3>

  <p>In 2022 I read 46 books. These are the five books which I would recommend most strongly:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Nothing But The Truth: Stories of Crime, Guilt and the Loss of Innocence - Funny and revealing memoir about the author's experience of becoming a criminal barrister in the UK.</li>
    <li>Bury the Chains - The incredible true story of the multi decade political effort to end slavery in the British empire.</li>
    <li>Recollections of My Nonexistence: A Memoir - Beautiful prose by one of my favourite authors (Rebecca Solnit).</li>
    <li>Fingersmith - Incredible queer fiction which keeps you guessing till the very end.</li>
    <li>The Power - Excellently written fiction that considers a world where women are suddenly able to physically dominate men and all the ways in which this might affect society.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>2021</h3>

  <p>In 2021 I read 47 books. These are the five books which I would recommend most strongly:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      An Everlasting Meal: Cooking with Economy and Grace - A beautifully written book which argues for a new relationship with cooking as a day by day process rather than a transactional chore. May
      change your life.
    </li>
    <li>Testosterone: An Unauthorized Biography - A critical examination of several of the pervasive myths about what testosterone is and what role it plays.</li>
    <li>
      Boys & Sex: Young Men on Hookups, Love, Porn, Consent, and Navigating the New Masculinity - Through interviews with dozens of young boys and young men, Orenstein recounts in painstaking and
      sometimes graphic detail the world that young boys are growing up in and the world that they are learning how to navigate. She writes about toxic masculinity, sexual assault and rape, the Me Too
      movement and so much more all through the lens of how it is affecting the world that young boys are growing up in. She writes about how so many boys still see themselves as one of the good guys
      even though many of them have committed sexual assault against women they know. (Description copied from a Goodreads review).
    </li>
    <li>
      Strange Bedfellows: Adventures in the Science, History, and Surprising Secrets of STDs - Never have I laughed so hard while learning so much! Ina Park is a master at breaking down barriers and
      making uncomfortable topics accessible and enjoyable. This is a must read for anyone who has had, is having, or will have sex. (Description copied from a Goodreads review)
    </li>
    <li>
      The Hate U Give - highly recommended: 16-year-old Starr Carter's life unravels when she becomes sole witness to the brutal murder of her childhood friend, Khalil Harris. Khalil was an unarmed
      black boy gunned down by a white police officer. (Description copied from a Goodreads review).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>2020</h3>

  <p>In 2020 I read 49 books. These are the five books which I would recommend most strongly:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The Power Broker - 1200 page true story about how Robert Moses wielded enormous power for decades in the US. Vital reading to better understand how power works.</li>
    <li>
      Fake Law - Essential and enraging. An informed look at the myths we're forcefed about the operation of the law (it's biased in favour of criminals! we pay far too much in legal aid!) and
      analyses not only the dreadful damage that's done to our rights and the body politic, but also takes a good look at who stands to gain from peddling these lies. Clue: it's not the general
      public. (Description copied from a Goodreads review).
    </li>
    <li>Revolting Prostitutes - Why sex work is work, and why criminalising sex work is so harmful.</li>
    <li>Mere Christianity - This book from 1942 is an attempt to examine what the core of Christianity is all about.</li>
    <li>
      Education of an Idealist - True story of one woman's journey from war reporter in Bosnia to being the US Ambassador to the UN - from trying to get the attention of the US government to being one
      of the key people attempting to effect change on the international stage.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>2019</h3>

  <p>In 2019 I read 51 books. These are the five books which I would recommend most strongly:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Hope In The Dark - Rebecca Solnit: An important source of hope in these difficult times.</li>
    <li>
      This Changes Everything - Naomi Klein: Explains why the status quo of WTO global trade rules are incompatible with the action we need on climate change. I'm not doing the book justice with that
      technical description - Naomi Klein is a powerful writer, and you should read what she has to say.
    </li>
    <li>
      MIT Press Essential Knowledge: Sexual Consent - Milena Popova: The scripts and discourses which we learn about sex are not working for us. This book provides a concise and important introduction
      to thinking on this topic.
    </li>
    <li>
      Manufacturing Consent - Noam Chomsky - Probably one of the most important books I've read in a while. Sets out the reasons why a free press still fails to impartially report on events. I found
      the book a bit too in depth, and skimmed some sections, but the underlying message is so important.
    </li>
    <li>
      Economix - Michael Goodwin: An excellent look at the history of why we run our economy the way we do, and the reasons that it's so broken. I found this to be a super accessible and compelling
      read.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>2017</h3>

  <p>In 2017 I read 45 books. These are the six books which I would recommend most strongly:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Sexual Politics - excellent book from the 1970s about feminism.</li>
    <li>Happy City - the cities we have built suit our needs very poorly.</li>
    <li>Debt: The First 5000 years - the origins of money and how it has shaped our history.</li>
    <li>Drugs without the hot air - an evidence based examination of illicit drugs written by the same author as a paper arguing horse riding is more dangerous than MDMA.</li>
    <li>When Breath Becomes Air - biography of a man who tried to find meaning by studying literature, then working as a neurosurgeon and finally dealing with his own
      mortality.</li>
    <li>Tiny Beautiful Things - beautifully written life advice. I've bought copies of this for two people since I read it.</li>
  </ol>
